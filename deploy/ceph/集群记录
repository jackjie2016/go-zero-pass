Enabling client.admin keyring and conf on hosts with "admin" label
Enabling autotune for osd_memory_target
You can access the Ceph CLI as following in case of multi-cluster or non-default config:

        sudo /usr/sbin/cephadm shell --fsid ba02c4b4-8906-11ed-8e49-000c299a2687 -c /etc/ceph/ceph.conf -k /etc/ceph/ceph.client.admin.keyring

Or, if you are only running a single cluster on this host:

        sudo /usr/sbin/cephadm shell

Please consider enabling telemetry to help improve Ceph:

        ceph telemetry on
